        <p>
            This website uses third parties that may be placing and reading cookies

        <p>
            The WIFINOMIC.com Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
            A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
            Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
            Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
            in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
            save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
            returned to a specific page.
            For example, if you personalize WIFINOMIC.com pages, or register
            with WIFINOMIC.com site or services,
            a cookie helps WIFINOMIC.com to recall your specific
            information on subsequent visits.
            This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such
            as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
            When you return to the same WIFINOMIC.com Web site, the information you previously provided can be
            retrieved,
            so you can easily use the WIFINOMIC.com features that you customized.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
            Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
            your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
            If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
            the interactive features of the WIFINOMIC.com services or Web sites you visit.
